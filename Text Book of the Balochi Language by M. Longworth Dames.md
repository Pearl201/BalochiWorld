**INTRODUCTION.**

This Balochi language textbook has been prepared at the request of the Government of Punjab in order to provide a suitable resource for examinations in Balochi.

Because there were previously no published materials in Balochi from which such a book could be compiled, the contents were collected directly from the spoken narratives of native speakers. This approach increases the value of the work, as it reflects the living, contemporary language. Balochi does not have a separate “literary” dialect distinct from everyday speech; the language used in this book represents forms commonly spoken by ordinary people. The main exception is poetry, which, although preserved orally rather than in writing, has often been transmitted for generations and may contain archaic or stylistically conventional expressions not found in daily conversation.

The materials in this book primarily represent the Sulaimānī (Eastern) branch of the Balochi language, which is spoken in the Nasirabad, Kacchi, Lower Derajat region and the adjoining hill areas.

Within this Eastern dialect area, two main varieties appear: the dialect of the Leghari and other northern tribes, and the dialect of the Mazari and southern tribes. The southern variety closely resembles that spoken by the Marri and Bugti communities (including the Shambani), the Baloch groups of Kachhi, and the tribes near the Bolan Pass, such that they may be regarded as a single dialect. One notable difference is the use of certain vocabulary, for example: the Mazari, Marri, and Bugti groups use “thi” meaning other, whereas the Kachhi and Bolan tribes use “phithi.”

The northern/Leghari variety differs mainly in grammatical endings, which tend to be shorter or less pronounced. For instance, the plural ending “ant” is often reduced to “en” or “an,” and “m” may be nasalized as “nw.” The final “th” of the third-person singular Aorist and the second-person plural Imperative is often omitted (e.g., da for dath, khane for khaneth, ravagha for ravaghath). Some vocabulary varies as well. as —

Nyanwah, in, for lafa.
Mana-aghen, is coming, for phedhaghea.
Mana-araghen, is bringing, for araghen.
Khori, pursuit, for khuni.
Thanav, halt, for otak.
Khair, ox, for kharighar.

There is a common phonological alternation in certain past participles where tk appears in place of kht, such as atka for akhta and sutka for sutha. This feature is found not only in the northern varieties but also in Makrani (Western) Balochi. Although frequent in the Leghari and other northern dialects, it is not universal; for the sake of consistent spelling, it has not been adopted in the main text.

Beyond these phonological differences, the northern varieties spoken by the Leghari and neighbouring communities show notable influence from Multani/Saraiki (Jatki) through longstanding contact, visible both in vocabulary and, in some cases, grammatical structure. By contrast, the Balochi spoken in Kachhi and in the Marri region shows stronger influence from Sindhi and Brahui due to geographical and cultural proximity.

In this Textbook, the sections written in the Leghari (Northern Sulaimānī/Eastern) dialect are Stories 1–4, 10, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 33 of Part I. The remainder of Part I and the whole of Part II represent the Southern Sulaimānī/Eastern dialect.
In Part III (Poems), Nos. 1–4 may also be placed within the southern group: No. 1 originates from a Shambani source, No. 2 from Marri speakers, and Nos. 3 and 4 from Mazari speakers. Poem No. 6 is Gurchani and therefore belongs to the northern set.

Although there are observable differences between these northern and southern varieties, they remain mutually intelligible and represent regional forms of the broader Sulaimānī (Eastern) Balochi dialect continuum. This variety differs significantly from Makrani (Western Balochi), which is not the subject of this Textbook. Students seeking a detailed treatment of Makrani Balochi may consult the grammars of E. Pierce and Major E. Mockler.

During the preparation of this Textbook, the Balochi Stories collected by the Reverend A. Lewis were published. This collection is especially valuable for its representation of northern Sulaimānī material. Several stories in both works overlap, a result of both collections drawing from the same narrator, Lashkaran Haddiani. Stories 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 28 of Part I correspond to Lewis’s Nos. VII, VIII, XIX, X, XXI, XXII, and III respectively, though variations in wording occur. Stories 6, 7, and 29 resemble Lewis’s Nos. VI, XV, and II in plot—though obtained from different narrators—and Story 17 (Dosten and Shiren) also appears in Lewis’s collection in an alternate version.

The grammar included at the start of this Textbook is a revised and expanded form of the author’s earlier work, A Sketch of the Northern Balochi Language (Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, Supplement, 1880).

**BALOCHI GRAMMAR.**

**THE ALPHABET.**

Historically, Balochi has been primarily an oral language, with most written communication carried out in Persian, which served as the administrative and literary medium of the region. As a result, systematic writing in Balochi developed relatively recently, and conventions of spelling have not yet become fully standardized.

In this Textbook, the Roman script is used because it allows for a clearer and more consistent representation of the phonology of Balochi, particularly its vowel system, which is more difficult to render unambiguously in the Persian–Arabic script. Nevertheless, it is helpful for the learner to become familiar with how Balochi is written in the Persian script, as this remains the script most widely recognized by Balochi speakers.

The following table presents the approximate correspondences between Persian and Roman characters:

**The Persian Alphabet as applied to Balochi.**

| Persian. | Roman. | Value. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ا | a, i, u, a, e, ai, o, au | As in Persian, an initial introducing all vowels. With the short vowels marks it forms a, i, u. With maddah it forms a. With following it forms i, e, ai. With following it forms u, o, au. As a medial and final it is always a. |
| ب | b | As in English and Persian. |
| ﭖ | p | Aspirated p. |
| ﺕ | t | Dental t as in Persian. |

| ﻑ | f | A pure labial f, not partly dental as English f. |
| ﻕ | q | A guttural k. |
| ﻙ | k | As English k without any palatalization as in Persian. |
| ﮒ | g | G hard as in English and Persian without palatalisation. |
| ﻝ | l | As in English and Persian. |
| ﻡ | m | As English m. |
| ﻥ | n, n | As English n. Also as a slightly pronounced guttural nasal, as in the final n of Persian or Hindustani plurals. (Sanskrit anusvara). |

**BALOCHI SOUNDS.**

**I. — CONSONANTS.**

**Gutturals.**

ک k correspond with Persian k, which however more usually appears in Balochi as خ kh or x. kh.

خ kh as an initial represents Persian ک k or خ kh ; e.g.—
B. khush-agh P. khush-tan
B. khar P. khar
B. khan-agh P. kun

As a final it sometimes represents گ g ; e.g.—
B. gwankh P. ganj
B. gurkh P. gurg

خ kh seldom occurs initially, its place being taken by ک. As a final it corresponds with Persian k or g ; e.g.—
B. hakh P. khak
B. rekh P. reg

گ g corresponds either with Persian g or b. As an initial g answers to b (original v); e.g.—
B. gandim P. gandum
B. gist P. bist
B. gwath P. bad
B. gwafagh P. baftan
B. geth P. bed

غ gh hardly ever appears as an initial. As medial it corresponds with Persian g and h; as a final usually with h (whether pronounced or mute in modern Persian); also occasionally with g; e.g.—
B. jaghar P. jigar
B. nigbah P. nigah
B. dighar P. dihar
B. jigh P. zih
B. roshagh P. rofah
B. ragh P. rag

In the words saghar 'head' P. sar, and naghan 'bread' P. nan, the gh has no consonant corresponding to it in the Persian.

The gh appears to be inherent in past participles, answering to the final h of the Persian, but it is not heard except in compound forms when followed by a vowel. Thus khutha, p. p. of khanagh means 'done,' but khutha-gh-ant 'they have done.'

ں n frequently occurs as a final in the place of n or nt; e.g.—
khanaghen = khanaghant.

Occasionally owing to a nasal style of pronunciation, nw stands for m and h is interpolated as a final; e.g.—
nyanwan = nyama

**Palatals.**

چ ch generally corresponds with the same letter in Persian.

چھ chh also represents Persian ch; e.g.—
B. chhath P. chah
B. chham P. chashm

ج j corresponds either with original Persian j or z; e.g.—
B. jihan P. jahan
B. jan P. zan
B. jigh P. zih

جھ jh is only found in words of Indian origin.

The cerebral consonants are found almost entirely in words of Indian origin. Before a dental, ر r is occasionally pronounced; r, as mard for mard gartha for gartha; but this is not universal and has not been marked in the Vocabulary. Lewis represents this by d, but I have never heard it so pronounced.

**Dentals.**

ت t represents an original t, which however more usually becomes تھ th.

تھ th as an initial commonly represents an original t. As a final, and after a consonant medially, it often corresponds with Persian د d; e.g.—
B. thakhta P. takhta
B. thafar P. tabar
B. arth P. arad
B. khanth P. kunad
B. burtha P. burda

ث th (pronounced as in Arabic, like English th in nothing, health) does not occur initially. As a medial and final it corresponds with Persian د d. As a final it does not occur, unless preceded by a vowel; e.g.—
B. brath P. biradar
B. gwath P. bad
B. roth P. ruda
B. roth, P. ravad
B. sith P. sud
B. rasitha P. rasida

Occasionally final th represents an original Zend th which is lost in modern Persian, as chhath a well, Zend chartka, Persian chah; gith, ordure, Zend gutha, Persian guh.

د d corresponds with Persian د d as an initial and occasionally after a consonant; e.g.—
B. dam P. adam
B. khandagh P. khand-idan

دھ dh only occurs in words of Indian origin.

ذ dh (pronounced like English th in mother, breathe) never occurs initially. As final and medial it corresponds with Persian د d; e.g.—
B. didhar P. didar.
B. sadh P. sad
B. rodh P. rod

In some verbs dh as characteristic represents a consonant which is lost in modern Persian; e.g.—
B. rudh-agh, p. p. rustha P. rustan, ru
B. nyadh-agh, p. p. nyastha P. nihadan, nih
B. shodh-agh, shustha P. shustan, shu

In these cases the dh represents a Zend d or dh, as shudhagh to hunger, Zend, shuvdha; shodhagh to wash, Zend, kshud; rudhagh to grow, Zend, rud. Similarly in nouns, phadh foot corresponds to Zend padha.

In madhakh 'locust' dh corresponds with ل l in Persian malakh. Here it represents the original Zend dh in madhakha.

In nadhar it represents Arabic ذ in نذر

ن n corresponds with Persian ن n.

**Labials.**

پ p corresponds with Persian پ p, also with ف f before a consonant; e.g.—
B. hapt P. haft
B. gwapta P. bafta

پھ ph as an initial represents Persian پ p and ف f; e.g.—
B. phanch P. panj
B. phusht P. pusht
B. phur P. pur
B. phrah P. farakh

ف f seldom occurs initially, its place being taken by ph. As a medial and final, it commonly represents Persian ب b; e.g.—
B. thafar P. tabar
B. shaf P. shab
B. af P. ab

ب b corresponds with Persian ب b as an initial and when not preceded by a vowel.

بھ bh is found only in words of Indian origin.

و w, v, has two sounds. The most usual is that of English w, which it receives generally when followed by a vowel, and the other that of a labial v (bh in Bell's palaeotype), which it receives when followed by a consonant or as a final, and in borrowed words of Sindhi origin. With both pronunciations it often corresponds with Persian ب b; e.g.—
B. zawan P. zaban
B. warna P. barna
B. savz P. sabz
B. whav P. khwab

Combined with h, w is pronounced like English wh in which; wh and w alone often correspond with Persian خو khw or خ followed by a labial vowel (u, u, o). The guttural is either preserved in the aspirate h. or more frequently lost altogether (see h); e.g.—
B. whan P. khwan
B. whar P. khwar
B. wash P. khush
B. wan-agh P. khwan-dan
B. war-agh P. khwar-dan

م m corresponds with Persian م m.

**Sibilants.**

س s corresponds with Persian س s.

ش sh as an initial corresponds with Persian ش sh. As a final and medial it corresponds either with sh or z; e.g.—
B. shaf P. shab
B. ash P. az
B. Damash P. namaz
B. seshin P. sozan
B. rosh P. roz

Sher 'below' corresponds with Persian zer, but there is no other case of initial sh corresponding with z. Sher may be a contraction of ash-er 'from below.'

ز z corresponds either with Persian س s or ز z; e.g.—
B. zuwar P. suwar

In the following words z corresponds with Persian د, viz.—
B. zi P. di
B. zan-agh P. dan-istan
B. zamath P. damad

In zi 'yesterday,' mazain 'great,' zanagh 'know,' zainayi 'son-in-law,' and zirde, a poetical word meaning 'heart,' the original Zend z is preserved.

In zik and zaragh z corresponds with the j of Sindhi jik and jara, but these words may have been borrowed by Sindhi. Cf. Pashto zik.

ژ zh corresponds with Persian ش sh, ز z and ج j; e.g.—
B. duzhman P. dushman
B. azhojan P. asman
B. drazh P. daruz
B. wazha P. khwaja

**Semi-vowels.**

ی y, ر r, and ل l correspond with the same letters in Persian.

ہ h generally represents an old Persian h, modern Persian ه h or خ kh; e.g.—
B. hushk P. khushk
B. hon P. khun
B. hikh P. khuk
B. phrah P. farakh

In hedh, sweat, h represents the Zend q or hv in qaedha.

Borrowed Arabic words beginning with خ undergo a similar change, as—
B. hair A. khair
B. hatar A. khatar

The above noted correspondences may be tabulated as follows :—

| Persian. | Balochi. |
| :--- | :--- |
| ک initial | k as an initial kh |
| خ initial | h, kh |
| گ initial | g |
| چ initial | chh |
| ت initial | th |
| د initial | d |
| پ initial | p |
| ف initial | ph |
| ب initial | b |
| ش medial/final | sh, zh (occasionally) |
| س initial/medial | s |
| ز initial | z |
| ز medial/final | z, zh (occasionally) |
| ه initial | h (occasionally omitted) |

It will be noticed that the aspirates of the surd row (kh, chh, th) are very common, replacing the corresponding unaspirated Persian consonants, while those of the sonant row (g'h, jh, dh, bh) seem to be entirely confined to words of Indian and Brahui origin.

The letters kh, gh, th, dh and f are usually medials or finals, representing the Persian letters shown in the above table. Th and dh are never initials, and kh, gh and f, when they occur in borrowed words of modern introduction as initials, are usually pronounced kh, g and ph.

An initial h is occasionally lost altogether; e.g.—
B. asten P. hastand
B. am P. ham

**II. — Vowels.**

The vowel-sounds in Balochi generally agree with those of Khurasani Persian. They may be arranged as follows :—

Long a, i, u
Short a, i, u
Diphthongs e, ai, o, au

The most noticeable point of difference from Persian is the frequent substitution of the palatal series i, i, e for the labial series u, u, o; e.g.—
B. sith P. sud
B. dir P. dur
B. seshin P. sozan
B. gandim P. gandum
B. bitha P. buda
B. hikh P. khuk
B. wasi P. khusu
B. sirmugh P. surma

A similar change sometimes affects borrowed Arabic words; e.g.—
B. malim A. malum
B. bir A. bur

In a few cases the change is reversed; e.g.—
B. osht-agh P. ist-adan
B. suft P. sev

Other variations from the Persian vowel system are rare.

**THE NOUN.**

**I. — Terminations.**

1. Balochi nouns in their formation correspond closely with Persian. The original terminal vowels have been lost, and the majority of nouns now terminate in consonants. There is no distinction of gender.

2. Vowel-endings —

a. The majority of nouns ending in a are borrowed from Sindhi or Arabic. In the former case a sometimes represents Sindhi o, therein corresponding more nearly with Punjabi; e.g.—
Ar. haya, dua
Si. bha, jhera, thora, trama, vela.

The words wazha, za, chawa, pasna and bega are not borrowed. Of these wazha (P. khwajah) and bega in inflected forms drop the h and take the termination ah as a base of inflection; e.g.—
wazha, pl. wazhahan, lords
bega : abl. begaha, in the evening.

The borrowed noun vela, time, is simply treated. Other nouns ending in a take no inflections. Some Sindhi nouns as jhera, thora have an alternative form in o which can be inflected.

i. This is a common termination, being commonly used as in Persian to form abstracts, as duzi 'theft' from duz 'thief,' saki 'strength' from sak 'strong,' &c., also as the termination of other abstract nouns not directly formed from Balochi bases as shadhi 'rejoicing,' ziyani 'injury,' It occurs, also in other nouns as godi 'lady,' druhani 'pistol,' mafarqi 'congratulation,' pahli 'rib' (P. pahlu). As a termination of borrowed words i is also found, as in chari 'spy,' mehi 'buffalo,' phalli 'section of a tribe.'

o is of frequent occurrence both in pure Balochi and in borrowed words; e.g.—

Balochi—
dithlo, smoke (P. dud).
shathlo, dove
bathlo, mortar
nakho, uncle
gokho, span
mokho, spider
go, race, prize
jo, water-course
gwando, alligator
jaddo, cave
phalo, direction
surgo, speech
lero, camel

Borrowed —
daddo, pony (Si. daddo)
pareddo, echo (Si. parendo)
ghoro, a band of horse
shaddo, a turban
lekho, reckoning.

This o nearly corresponds in sound to the close English o, and never has the open Italian sound. Most words ending in o change it to av when followed by a vowel, whether this vowel commences a following word or an inflectional suffix. Those of the first eight words in the above list (dithlo to jo inclusive) does not undergo this change. Go and jo are radical words, and the others end in the syllables lo and kho which probably had originally a distinct force of their own; e.g.—
nakho  inflected forms  nakhoan
but phalo  inflected forms  phalava
jaddo  inflected forms  jaddava

Dihav 'leopard' may be classed with words ending in o, though I have never heard the termination pronounced otherwise than av. This v is a purely labial sound, not the English v.

u as a termination does not seem to occur in pure Balochi words. It is found in a few words of Sindhi origin and undergoes no change in inflections; e.g.—
anu, an egg.
tilu, a bell
varu, a beam
limu, a lemon (Arabic).

E has not been met with except in kahno 'pigeon,' also pronounced kahni.

Au is only found in jau 'barley.'

3. Special terminations —

(a) Verbal Nouns.

Agh, This is the termination of the infinitive and verbal noun which corresponds with it in form. It apparently corresponds with the Pashto verbal noun in ahl, as final gh in Balochi generally corresponds with Persian h. Agh, as a termination corresponds with the Persian termination ah in many other nouns; e.g., ramagh "a flock of goats," ahanjagh "a saw," &c. Some are verbal nouns in form as gwanzagh "a swing." The termination agh also forms collective nouns as murdanagh "the fingers," from murdan, phadhagh "legs," from phadh.

Okh. This termination forms the noun of agency from the verbal base and may be used with almost any verb; e.g., thursokh "a coward," from thursagh "to fear"; warokh "an eater," from waragh. These nouns of agency can be used and inflected as adjectives; e.g.—
mirokh, a fighter
mirokhen bing, fighting dog,

Okh is occasionally found in other nouns besides those of agency, as in gannokh "fool."

(b) Abstract Nouns.

i. This is the commonest termination for abstract nouns, which may be formed from other nouns or adjectives; e.g., duzi "theft," sakmardi "valour," ghami "grief."

Adh. Used in forming abstracts from adjectives of dimension; as—
gwandadh, shortness
drazhadh, length
phrahadh, breadth.

This termination adh corresponds to the Persian a in firakha breadth, garma, pahna, sarma, &c. The Pehlevi in similar words has the termination ak. Possibly the original form was ata, atak. The former would explain the Balochi and the latter the Pehlevi form.

uta; in azmuta 'examination' from azmainagh
ar; as didhar 'sight,' raftar 'paces.'

**(c) Collective Nouns.**

Agh. See above under verbal nouns.

gal. This is most usually employed to form collectives; e.g.—
jangal, a band of women from jan
zabgal, a flock of kids from zah
pahar, as gwar-pahar, a flock of lambs

**(d) Diminutives.**

Ak, akh, ikh. This termination is frequently employed to form diminutives, sometimes modifying the base; e.g.—
janikh or jinkh, girl, from jan woman
gwarakh, lamb, from the base gwar — cf. gurand ram, and gwar-pahar flock of lambs
kisanakh, very small, from kisain

This termination is occasionally used when all diminutive signification has been lost, as wasarikh, "father-in-law" (Persian khusar).

Ko, occasionally used, as in kisanro, a diminutive of kisain 'small'. Possibly the termination lo in dithlo shathlo had originally the force of a diminutive. Compare also the adverbs khamro "a very little," from kham, and chiklo "a little".

**4. Compound nouns and adjectives**

Compounds are numerous, and may be classed under the Sanskrit divisions of Dwandwa, Tatpurusha, Karmadharaya and Bahuvrihi, or Copulative, Qualifying, Descriptive and Possessive.

a. Copulative. This class consists of nouns inseparably coupled together, only the latter being subject to inflection; e.g.—
phol-phurs, enquiry
thaukh-tawar, conversation
chukh-chori, children
math-phith, parents

b. Qualifying or Dependent. In this class the latter member of the compound is qualified by the former. The latter member may be either a noun or a verbal root, the verbal noun in okh being occasionally but not often used; e.g.—

(1) When both members are nouns—
jogin-dar, a pestle (lit. mortar-stick)
mazar-dumb, a plant (lit. tiger-tail)
rosh-asan, sunrise
chaga-halwar, a matter of jest
chham-phusht, eyelid
mah-ghuma, eclipse of the moon.

(2) When the first member is a noun and the latter a verbal root;—
shir-war, milk-drinking
rozh-gir, eclipse of the sun (sun-seizing)
godhan-din, under-tearing (name of a plant)
sha-khash, night-expeller (the planet Venus)
mar-khushokh, man slayer
sangband, connected by marriage.

c. Descriptive. In this class the first member is an adjective, numeral or other word simply describing or defining the second, e.g.—
syah-af, perennial stream (lit. black water)
drazhdar, a beam (long-wood)
madhsfor, female wild ass
ergwath, the leeside (lit. down wind)
chyar-gist, four score

d. Possessive. These are formed in a similar manner to the last class with the force of adjectives or descriptive epithets, the possession of the qualities described being implied; e.g.—
hor-dast, empty-handed
phash-phadh, barefoot
gweth-rish, grey-beard
syah-gwar, black-breast (e.g., the black partridge)
phodhah-demi, the name of a flower (lit. thither-faced)
dir-zanagh, far knowing
dast-basthagh, hands joined

**5. Inflection of nouns**

The suffixes used in forming the different cases are a, ar, egh, egha, en, e, ah, ahra, ani and anegh, but these suffixes are put to a great variety of uses which will be considered under the different cases.

The most usual inflection is that in a. It may be used as an instrumental or nominative with verbs in a past tense, as an accusative, ablative and locative; its place is to a certain extent taken in the plural by the suffix ani, the use of which is however more restricted.

**Singular.**

The nominative. The nominative of all intransitive verbs and of transitive verbs in the present and future, is the simple uninflected noun. With transitive verbs in tenses derived from the past participle the instrumental construction is employed, the inflected form in a being used for the agent, while the object is left uninflected.

Genitive. — The most usual method of expressing the genitive is to place the uninflected noun with a genitive signification before the qualifying noun, as—
an mard bachh, that man's son.

Occasionally the termination en is used in this formation, the noun in the genitive being treated as an adjective, as—
gindi admin randeti, he sees there are men's tracks.
When the noun is a genitive signification follows instead of preceding the qualifying noun, the terminations egh, egha and sometimes simple e are used.

Examples. — An phalawa rahi bitha daryaegha, he started off in the direction of the river.
Ya zale matie mastaghe zurthiya Sraghen, a woman is lifting up and bringing a bowl of curds.

Dative. — The termination ar or ar is employed for the dative, as e mardumar naghan datha'i, he gave the man bread.

Accusative. — The most usual ending of the accusative is a, but ar is frequently used, especially when emphasis is required or to distinguish a nearer object from a more remote; e.g., ma Balochiya roti-ar naghan khanuh, in Balochi we call "roti" naghan.

The termination a is never used for the accusative with the past tense of transitive verbs; in short, when the nominative is inflected the accusative is uninflected; and, vice versa, in the other tenses, when the nominative is uninflected the accusative receives the inflection.

Examples. — Balocha wathi bachh di badshah bachh di burtha-ghant.
Hoka khuthai hawan ki main bachha biyari iklitar ikhtiar jagir dean-i,' — Part I, 14.
The Baloch carried off both his own son and the king's son.
He made a proclamation "whoever brings back my son shall receive such and such jagir."

Ablative, Locative. — The inflected form in a is used with the prepositions go "with," azh "from," pha "on," man "in," gawar "in possession of," dan "into," and avr "in, upon" which alone precede the noun. It also expresses without a preposition, position, motion to or from, time when. The meaning *from* is often implied without the use of the preposition azh; e.g.—
Ah ki khal chi kadhira, whatever thing comes from God
Bahr-khanani go hadhira, that I will divide with my heart
Har shakha hazar shaki bitha, on every branch a thousand branches sprang
Har shaka wathi gul bitha, on every branch its own flower.

**Plural.**

An. The termination ah is used for the nominative and accusative plural, but the singular forms are perhaps more frequently used. With numerals the singular is almost exclusively used.

Ahra. The plural dative in ahra is also of rare occurrence, the singular being more frequently used.

Ani. This is the most usual plural suffix, being always used for the genitive and ablative; e.g.—
pakhtani khund, the vale of poplars.

When the genitive follows, instead of preceding the qualifying noun, the termination anegh may be used instead of ani.

Example. — E shahr faqiranegh eh ? is this a town of faqirs?

**The suffix e.**

e is used in the sense of an indefinite article; e.g., mard 'man'; marde 'a man.'

The indefinite base formed by the suffix e is used as a base of inflection, the case endings following the e. Thus from marde we get mardea and mardear.

The suffix e, besides its use as an indefinite article, has the sense of some, any, what sort of, &c., as is shown in the following examples:—

Example. — Lysive chin biyar ki wharde khanuh, collect and bring some wood that we may prepare some food. -- Part I, 12.
Tho phedha mazar rande dithae, have you seen any track of a tiger here? — Part I, 6.
Tho dosht chi kare khanaghathe, what sort of work were you doing last night? — Part I, 24.

It also has the definite sense of one, as in the following:—

Example. — Dris ya shafea ya roshea nishta. Dris sat for one night and one day. — Part I, 15.

The complete inflection of the noun is shown below, under the words mard, man, and lero, camel.

**MARD, MAN.**

**Singular.**

| Case | Definite form. The man. | Indefinite form. A man. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nom., Instr. & Acc. | mard | marde |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nom., Instr., Acc. &c. | lero | lerave |

| Case | Definite form. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nom., Instr., Acc. &c. | leravan |
| Gen. | leravani |
| | leravanegh |
| Dat. | leravanra |

**ADJECTIVES.**

1. Adjectives are formed by the terminations i, en, ena, agh, o, an, egh from nouns and adverbs; e.g.—

i. demi, former from dem
phadhi, hinder from phadha

en, ena. marden, manly from mard
nughraen, nughraena, of silver from nughra.

agh. gandagh, bad from gand

o. gwatho, windy from gwath

egh. daregh, wooden from dar

2. Adjectives usually precede nouns and generally take the termination en when used with nouns, unless the original termination happens to be en; as—
nughraen aden, a silver mirror
but
gwathoeri halwar, windy talk.

The adjectives jowain, good, kisain, small, and mazain, great, form respectively before nouns jowanen, kisanen, and mazanen.

Occasionally idiom or emphasis requires that the adjective should not precede the noun, but follow it. The termination is then ena or enan, instead of en.

Example. — Gunah maaf khan, guda, man thara rasten hal dean phila-vena, pardon my fault, and I will give you a true and full account.

Numerals are similarly treated either when they follow the noun or are used by themselves,

Example. — E haptenan dir bare nyadh 5, take these seven and place them at a distance. Part I, 31.

3. Comparison. The comparative degree is formed by the suffix thar, thir or tar; e.g.—

Positive: kisain, small
Comparative: kisanthar and kasthar

Positive: burz, high
Comparative: burzathir

Positive: mazain, great
Comparative: masthar

Positive: jowain, good
Comparative: jowanthar

Positive: sak, strong
Comparative: sakthar,

the base being sometimes slightly modified. The word bathir (Pers. bihtar) is sometimes used with other adjectives to express comparison; as—
bathir gandagh, worse.

The word geshtar "more" corresponds to the Pers. beshtar, but the positive is wanting in Balochi.

"Than" in comparison is expressed by azh, whether the adjective is put in the comparative degree or not; e.g.—
Azh tho nekhen, he is better than thou,

There is no special superlative form. The comparative form may be used, or the adverbs sakia "extremely," hudhai "divinely" may be employed to give emphasis to the adjective. The phrase azh thewaghen or azh kullan "of all" may also be used with the comparative to give a superlative sense; e.g.--
Azh thewaghen masthar, the greatest of all.

Compound numbers are treated as single words in forming the ordinal; as—
Gist-yakumi Twenty-first
Gist-phanchumi Twenty-fifth

**III. Fractional Numbers.**

one-half (1/2) nem, nemagh
one-third (1/3) saiak
one-quarter (1/4) pao, chyarak
one-fifth (1/5) phanjak
three-quarters (3/4) sai-pao
one-and-a-half (1 1/2) yak nem or dedh
with one-half more sadhcan
e.g., four-and-a-half (4 1/2) sadhcan chyar

With minuter fractions the word bahr is employed with the ordinal number, as Gistumi bahr, one-twentieth.

**IV. Multiples.**

a. Multiples of quantity, expressed in English by the word "fold"—
dura double
yake sai threefold
yake chyar fourfold
yake phanch fivefold
and so on as required.

b. Multiples of time expressed generally by the word bar, corresponding to the similar use of "times" in English. Bar is put in the plural except in ya-bare "once," where it receives the indefinite suffixes. Thi-bare "another time" is similarly constructed:
ya-bare once
do-baran twice
sai-baran thrice
chyar-baran four times
and so on.

**PRONOUNS.**

**I. Personal Pronouns.**

**First person—**

**Singular.**
Nom. man, mah I
Gen. mani, main my
Dat. maigh mine
Acc. manan me, to me
Instr. ma I,
Abl. azh ma, go ma from me, with me, &c

**Plural.**
Nom. ma we
Gen. main our
Dat. maigh ours
Acc. mar, mara, us, to us
Instr. ma we, us, &c.
Abl.

In the 1st person plural of the present and imperfect of the verb to be, the form makh is used instead of ma, as makh-un, we are, makh-ath-un, we were. The preservation of the kh here points to a direct derivation from the Zend ahmakem, we.

Example. — Makh-on zahmjanen Lashari, we are sword-wielding Lasharis. Part II, 5.

**Second person—**

**Singular**
Nom. tho thou
Gen. thai thy
Dat. thaigh thine
Acc. thara, thar thee, to thee
Instr. thaa, tha thou, &c.
Abl.

**Plural.**
Nom. shawa, sha you
Gen. shawai, shai your
Dat. shawaigh yours
Acc. shawar, shar you
Instr. shawa, sha, you
Abl. &c.

With the present and imperfect of the verb to be shawakh is used instead of shawa, as shawakh-ethe, you are; shawakh-athe, you were. This form may be referred to the Zend khshmakem, you.

The forms maigh and thaigh, mine and thine, never precede the nouns.

Example. — Man thai zal-un, e badshahai di thaigh-en, I am thy wife and this kingdom is thine. — Part I, 31.

**II. Third Personal Pronoun and Demonstrative Pronouns.**

The demonstrative pronouns "this" and "that" take the place of the 3rd personal pronoun, which only exists independently in the form of the pronominal suffixes to be noticed hereafter; —

**1. Proximate demonstrative pronoun —**

**Singular.**
Nom. eeh, e, i this, he
Gen. eshi, eshiya of this, his
Dat. eshiyar to this, to him
Acc. eshiya, eshiyar this, him,
Instr. eshiya he
Abl. 'sh eshiya, go eshiya, &c. from this, from him &c.

**Plural.**
Nom. esh, eshan these, they
Gen. eshani of these, their
Dat. eshanra to these, to them
Acc. eshah, eshanra these, them
Instr. eshani these, they
Abl. 'sh eshani, &c. from them, &c.

An intensive form is used with the prefix ham, sometimes corrupted to haw, as hawe, hamesh, hameshiya, hameshani, &c., "this very one, by this one."

**2. Remote demonstrative pronoun —**

**Singular.**
Nom. an, anih that, he
Gen. anhi, anhiya of that, his
Dat. anhiyar to him, that
Acc. anhiyar, anhiya that, him
Instr. anhiya that, he
Abl. 'sh anhiya, &c. from him, &c.

**Plural.**
Nom. anhan, an those, they
Gen. anhani of those, their
Dat. anhanra to those, them
Acc. anhan, anhanra those, them
Instr. anhani those, they
Abl. 'sh anhani, &c. from them, &c.

This pronoun has also an intensive form with the prefix ham or haw in "that one," "that very one," as hawan, hawanhiya, &c. The uninflected forms an and e, hawan and hawe or hawen are used as demonstrative adjectives when prefixed to nouns.

Examples of demonstrative pronouns.

An chwar avzaran gire daeti, seize those four horsemen. — Part I, 31.
Anhiya mundri phanjyartho sur-gipta, she recognized the ring and set off. — Part I, 31.
Main dil na bhaahi e zal negha, my heart does not go out towards this woman, — Part I, 24.
Hawen drashk ki asten choshen ki-nangad-en, eshi bakhin ki khoren chhamar man-khane, chham guda druah bi, this tree is so magical, that if you apply its leaves to blind eyes, the eyes will be healed, — Part I, 24.

The compound forms imar and anmar (for i-mard and an mard) are frequently used in the sense of personal pronouns and are applied even to animals and inanimate objects.

**3. Pronominal suffixes —**

These are frequently employed with the verb when the regular pronouns are not expressed. Those of the 3rd person, i "he" and ish "they" are most frequently employed, the distinction between the singular and plural forms not being carefully observed. Usually these suffixes are attached to verbs. Examples of this use will be found on page 26. Occasionally they are attached to nouns.

Example. — Ma madrikhan shawashkaghun, khase giroki-i hi, we are selling beads, is there any purchaser of them? — Part I, 14.

The suffix an is also sometimes used in the 3rd person, as khuthaghant-an, "they did." The 1st person has also a suffix un, which is not so frequently used. With this suffix the verb takes a peculiar form, a euphonic t being inserted to strengthen the weak final of the 1st person singular or plural, as khushtaghantun or khushtaghuntun, "I or we killed."

**III. Relative Pronouns.**

The word ki performs most of the duties of a relative pronoun, as in Persian, and often merely has the meaning of a relative particle, being indeclinable, so that meaning is not complete without the use of other pronouns.

Example. - E mard hameshen ki eshia brath ma giptaghun. This is the man whose brother we have taken.

The following relative phrases are used:—
har khas ki whoever
har ki whoever
har chi ki whatever
an ki who, whoever, whatever.

Example. — Har khas ki khakit, every one who comes.
Har ki than gushe, whatever you say.
An ki khal chi kadhira, whatsoever thing comes from God.

**IV. Reflexives.**

Wath, self.

**Singular.**
Nom. wath self
Gen. wathi, wathigh own, one's own
Dat. wathar self
Acc.

**Plural.**
Nom. wathan selves
Gen. wathani own
Dat. wathanra selves
Acc.

The word wathi is used, like the Hindustani apna, to express the possessive pronoun with relation to the nominative of the sentence.

Example (use of wath). — Tho hukm diye, man wathi mardum wath whash khanan kharan, if you give the order, I will myself satisfy my husband and bring him back. — Part I, 24.

The words jind and but are also used in the sense of "self" — oneself, wathi wath or wathi jind;
Anmar wathi jindar khushta, he killed himself.

Jind is especially used in referring to one's own private property (as the Hindustani nij), e.g.—
Hawe madhin mani jindeghen, this mare is my own property.

The phrase pha-wathan is used for among themselves, ourselves, yourselves. Ma-wathan is found in the same sense among the southern tribes.

**V. Interrogatives.**

Who, khai?

**Singular and Plural.**
Nom. khai who?
Gen. khaigh whose?
Dat. khaiar whom?
Acc.

what? chi?
which, what (qualifying a noun) kithan, than
how much? chikhtar, chikar (P. chi qadr?)
how many?

**VI. Correlatives.**

so much iklitar, ikar (P. in qadr)
so many
just so much hawikhtar (P. hamin qadr)
that much anikhtar
just that much hawanikhtar

**VII. Indefinite.**

**THE VERB**

The simplest form or base of every verb is with one or two exceptions identical in form with the 2nd pers. sing. imperative. From this base are formed immediately, by the addition of certain terminations, the imperative, aorist, infinitive and present participle. The termination of the infinitive is agh. From the base so obtained two more tenses, the present and imperfect, are formed. The past participle is formed from the base in a manner which will be described hereafter, and other past participles are formed from it as a base.

**(a) Forms derived immediately from the base,**

**Imperative.**

The imperative, as observed above, generally is the simplest form of the base. Verbs beginning with vowels take the prefix ba or bi, and the verbs waragh "to eat" and ravagh "to go" also form their imperative bawar and baro. Verbs beginning with vowels take also the prefix bi or kh in the aorist. These prefixes are not used either in the imperative or aorist when a negative is expressed, the negative particles na, ni and ma taking their place; e.g.—
bijar bring
nayar do not bring
bilan I will let
nelan I will not let
khaiti he will come
nayaiyi he will not come

The prefix kh is most usually taken in the aorist, but the verb ilagh "to let" usually takes b.

**Aorist.**

The aorist has both indefinite, present, future and subjunctive significations. The terminations are as follows:—

**Singular.**
1. an
2. e, eth, edh
3. ith, th, ich, i

**Plural.**
1. un, om
2. e, eth, edh
3. ant

The most usual termination of the 3rd person singular is ith, which often becomes simply i. The following take th:—
Infinitive 3rd pers. sing aorist.
khanagh, to do khanth
janagh, to strike janth or jath
giragh, to take girth
baragh, to take away barth
waragh, to eat warth

In giragh gir is the radical form of the verb. In baragh and waragh the radical vowel is lengthened. The following take th:—
biagh, to be bith, bi
ravagh, to go roth, ro
deagh, to give dath, da
siagh, to swell sith.

**Present Participle.**

The present participle, used of a continued or repeated action, is formed from the base by the termination ana; e.g.—
Infinitive Present participle.
biagh biana
khanagh, khanana

**Infinitive.**

The infinitive in agh is a noun and can be inflected.
From the inflections of the infinitive the gerunds in a and i are formed.
The gerund in a has an active signification with the sense of "in order to."
Examples.— Khanagha khaptai. He fell a-doing, i.e., he began to do.
Man go sharaea giraghani, shawa manah ilagha neth. I am marrying him according to law: you are not to allow me (i.e., it is not for you to give me permission). — Part I, 20
Tho main Arzai-le; tho main khushagha aljtaghe. Thou art my death angel; thou art come to slay me. — Part I, 22

The gerund in i or e has a genitive or passive signification, and generally means possible, or capable of being done, or refers to the necessity of an action. Occasionally a euphonic gh is inserted after the i.

Example.— Chakur saken marden, main daraghi neh. Chakur is a powerful man, and not to be stopped by me. — Part II, 5.
Ma thaukt na khanun, ki mar gali janaghbi nawan. We do not speak, lest we should have to shut the door. — Part I, 9.
Mar pinjra lafa khanaghigh-ath. We should have put it in a cage. — Part I, 24.

The present and imperfect are formed from the infinitive by the following terminations:—

**Present.**
**Singular.**
1. ah
2. ae
3. eh

**Plural.**
1. uh, uom, u
2. ae, aeth
3. ant, an, en

**Imperfect.**
**Singular.**
1. athah
2. athae
3. athi, eth, a

**Plural.**
1. athuh
2. athae
3. athant

The past participle is formed by the addition of the suffix tha, ta or tha to the base which is liable to modifications to be noted below. For purposes of composition the past base ends in gh (See Sounds, gh). From the base so formed the perfect and pluperfect are formed by the following terminations:—

**Perfect.**
1. ah
2. e
3. —

**Plural.**
1. uh, om
2. e, eth
3. ant

**Pluperfect.**
1. athah
2. athae
3. ath, eth, a

**Plural.**
1. athuh
2. athae
3. athant

The 3rd person singular of the perfect is the simple form of the past participle without the gh. In transitive verbs with an object and agent this form expresses the perfect throughout the agent being in the inflected or instrumental form, while the object is uninflected; e.g.—
marduma naghan wartha, the man ate bread,
where marduma is the inflected form of mardum. But—
mardum naghana warth, the man will eat bread.
Here mardum is uninflected and naghan receives the objective inflection.

The pluperfect is used in describing an action completed before the time of the narrative, and does not necessarily correspond with the English use.

Examples.— Tho sukhn khuthagath go wathi zavana. Thou madest a promise with thy tongue — Part I, 4.
Tha manah ditha shuthagathae. Thou sawest me and didst depart. — Part I, 15.
Anmar ki chyar shafa nishta Mardana Badshah niyakhaotha. When he had waited four nights, and King Mardana had not come.

The terminations of the present are nearly identical with those of the perfect, and those of the imperfect with the pluperfect. Both seem to be formed by the addition of the present and past forms of the defective verb to be to the infinitive base and the past base respectively. The present with the infinitive base forms the present, with the past base the perfect. Similarly the past forms the imperfect and pluperfect. These forms are as follows:—

**Present.**
**Singular.**
1. an I am
2. e thou art
3. e, eh he is

**Plural.**
1. un we are
2. e, eth you are
3. ant they are

**Past.**
**Singular.**
1. athan I was
2. athae thou wast
3. athi he was

**Plural.**
1. athun we were
2. athae you were
3. athant they were

From the simple past participle which has both an active and passive signification are formed two other participles, viz., (1) the active past participle used of a completed action and only found before a verb in a past tense,— this is formed by changing the termination tha, ta into tho, to; (2) the present participle used of a continued but not repeated action. This is formed by changing tha or ta into thiya, tiya or sometimes thigha, tigha.

The use of the participles may be shown as follows:—
daragh, to hold.
Past { dashtha, held.
{ dashtho, having held,
Present { dashtiya } holding, continuing to hold.
{ dashtigha }
darana, holding (with intervals), keeping or taking hold.

Of course. Here is the corrected and completed text from the section on the Formation of the Past Participle through the end of the provided paradigms for the verbs "to be" and "to go".

***

**FORMATION OF THE PAST PARTICIPLE.**

The termination is either tha, tha or ta which is added to the base. Tha is the more usual. It is taken by all verbs whose bases end in a vowel. Verbs ending in mutes take tha as a rule, with a short vowel inserted after the characteristic; e.g., bashkagh "to give," p. p. bashkatha. When a verb corresponds with a Persian verb in idan, a short i is sometimes inserted; e.g.—
rasagh, to arrive p. p. rasitha (P. rasidan).
thursagh, to fear p. p. thursitha (P. tursidan).

When tha or ta is used it is always attached to the base without an intervening vowel. This leads frequently to the modification of the characteristic of the base, the changes corresponding closely with those which take place in Persian. In some verbs the vowel of the base is also changed, and others are wholly irregular. Verbs whose characteristic is n (a class which includes all causals) take the termination tha without any modification of the base.

The most usual changes of characteristic letters are sh and zh to ht, f to p, dh and z to s. Many verbs in sh and s take the termination without modifying the characteristic.

The following list gives the past participles of all the irregular verbs also most of those which form their past participle by taking tha without modification of the base. The verbs beginning with vowels which take the prefixes b, bi and kh in the imperative and aorist are also given:—

In addition to the perfect and pluperfect the following tenses are formed from the base of the past participle, viz.:—

**The Conditional.** — This is formed by the termination eh in the singular and ah in the plural. It occasionally takes the prefix bi.

Examples. — Khase ki bithen, lal chi gutha murdaghegha bokhteh biyartheh. If there were any one here he would undo the ruby from the neck of the corpse and bring it. — Part I, 24.
Dilar arman khuthai ki "hawai jawaih borathant; dreghah man warthenan." In his heart he was sorry saying "This was an excellent stew; it had been well had I eaten it." — Part I, 11.

When used in the negative the conditional takes the imperative participle ma instead of na.

Example. — Dankoh ma naghan phakko ma datheh, thi khase dastani naghan na warthath-i. Until I should bake his bread he would not eat bread from the hands of any other person. — Part I, 18.

**The Conditional Pluperfect and the Habitual Past.** — These tenses have two forms used indiscriminately for one or the other. One is simply the shortened past participle as dath from datha. The other is formed by adding the syllable ath to the base of the participle as warthath from wartha. This form is found in all numbers and persons, but it also has a fully inflected form, the terminations of the perfect being added to the base in ath, as—
1. Warthathan warthathun, om
2. Warthathe warthathe
3. Warthath warthathant

Examples. — Tho bratha thaukhe khuth, thara di sokhtathom. Hadst thou said a word for thy brother, I had burnt thee also. — Part I, 23.
Agh main thara paida ma khuthan, ma bak jihan paida na khuth. If I had not created thee, I should not have created the rest of the world.
Nawan thara warthath-ish. Perhaps they would have bitten you. — Part I, 25.

Example of Habitual Past — Jinkha phagegha kharo bith, Kuran parhith Dris paighamber di thaukh ashkhuth, guda an di parhith Kuran. Hawanhi dil-gosh dashtath-i, ki hawanhi thaukh washiya man-khakhtath-i. The girl would rise early and read the Kuran; Dris used to hear her voice, and then he too would recite the Kuran. She would fix her attention on him, for his voice used to sound sweet to her. — Part I, 15.

**Passive Voice.**

Transitive verbs have a passive voice, which is, however, not very extensively used. The infinitive is formed by adding ij to the verbal base. From this base an aorist is formed by the addition of the ordinary aorist terminations as in the active. The past participle of the active has also a passive signification, and from this is formed (1) a present corresponding in form to the active perfect, and an alternative form made by substituting iy for agh, as, I am struck, jathaghan or jathiyan; (2) an imperfect, which similarly corresponds with the active pluperfect, as I was struck, jathaghethan or jathiyethan.

In addition to the simple past participle as jatha, there is a present participle formed by adding iya or igha to the base of the past participle, as jathiya or jathigha, being struck. A past participle is also formed from the infinitive base, as janijatha, struck.

Examples of the passive.— Anmar ki giri guda bandij. If he is caught he will be bound.
Mahla galo jathiyeth, hawan hawar kharagha likhthagheth-i. The door of the palace was shut, and this sentence was written over it. — Part I, 12.

**Causals.**

The causal is commonly formed by adding the suffix ain to the root; e.g.—
tharagh, to return.
tharainagh, to cause to return, i.e., to give back.

Oshtagh, "to stand," and nindagh "to sit" form their causals, thus—
oshtagh— oshtalainagh.
nindagh— nishtainagh (to lay, spread out).

Some of the verbs given in the list on pages 22 -24 are causals, the intransitive verb becoming transitive by a change in the radical vowel resembling the Sanskrit guna, as—
sushagh, soshagh; thashagh, thashagh, thusagh, thosagh.

**Compound Verbs.**

Verbs are compounded with prepositions, with nouns and with other verbs. The most common of those compounded with prepositions will be found under the words: ler "down," man "in"; dar "out"; and go "with" in the vocabulary. In verbs which take the prefixes bi, b, and kh these are inserted after the prepositions, as are also the negative particles na and ma; e.g.—
phadya, together. Aragh, to bring,
phadya-aragh, to recognize,
phadya-kh arith, he will recognise,
phadya nayartha, he did not recognize.

Compound phrases of a noun and a verb are common. The verbs khanagh "to do," deagh "to give," janagh "to strike," and giragh "to take" are most commonly used in this way; e.g.—
sar-giragh, to set out
dem deagh, to send

One verb frequently qualifies another, the two verbs being used in the same sense and person throughout. The active past participle is never used unless followed by another past tense; e.g.—
ilagh deagh, to let go
bilan dean, I will let go
ishto datha, he let go
tharagh agh, to come back
tharah khan, I will go back
thartho akhtaghathan, I had come back.

**Pronominal Suffixes i and ish.**

These particles are appended to verbs and take the place of the pronouns of the third person when not expressed before the verb. The singular form is i and the plural ish, but in practice they are used almost indiscriminately. They express (1) the agent of the verb in the third person; (2) the object of an action, or the instrument by which it was performed; e.g.—

(1) khutha; did or done
anhiya khutha or \ he did
khutha-i,
ravaghathant-i, they were going
jatha-ish, they struck
hechi nestath-i, there was none of it (lit., anything was not of it).

(2) wath gindith-i, he will see himself
man kharan-i, I will bring it
harkhas phadya-kharith-i, every one recognizes him.

(3) with the imperative — bar-ish! Take them away!
Wazir miyaith, dareth-i. Do not let the Wazir come, stop him — Part I, 23.

The suffix an is occasionally used in the third person.

Example. — Sai hawar Mazari manzur khanant, guda phadha band; manzur ma khanant an phadha ma band. If the Mazaris agree to three things assume the turban (of chieftainship); if they do not agree to them, do not assume it.

**Shortened Infinitive.**

A form which may be called a shortened infinitive consists of the past participle base without the vowel termination, as akht, gipt, shuth, &c. It is used with the verb 'khanagh' in the sense of 'to be able' and 'biagh' in the sense of 'to be possible' or 'to be able.'

Examples. — Hudha isht na khuthan. He was unable to leave God's presence. — Part I, 15.
Ma nio hawen watana nisht na bun. We shall not be able now to stay in this country.

**Verbal Noun.**

From most verbs a verbal noun of agency can be formed by the suffix okh being added to the base; e.g.—
giragh, to take; girokh, taker, creditor,
khushagh, to kill: khushokh, murderer.

**(4).— Adverbs of Manner, &c.**

From most adjectives an adverb of quality or manner may be formed by the suffix iya, igha, or ikha, the adjective being sometimes slightly modified;
gandagh, bad: gandaghiya, badly
jowain, good: jowaniya, jowanikha, well
sak, strong: sakia, sakigha, very, extremely.

Other adverbs of manner are:—
phadya together
zithei quickly
nawan, kaizari perhaps
pharche why?
mundo altogether, certainly, doubtless
hanchoo, hachho thus
chachho? ebon? how?
e-ranga, e-r'ga in this way
anranga, anr'ga in that way
harranga every way
thanranga in what way?
hechi-na, china, mundo na never

**PREPOSITIONS.**

There are few prepositions, properly speaking, in Balochi, as most of the particles so used follow the noun, and would be more correctly called postpositions.

The following are prepositions proper and precede the noun which is governed in the oblique form (ablative or locative):—
go with, together with, in company with
gwar with, near, in possession of
pha on, for, among
man, man in, into
dan into, to, up to
azh, ash, shi from, than
avr on, into

Go and gwar are also found as postpositions,- gwar frequently, and go rarely.

From the above, some prepositional phrases are formed, of which the first member precedes, and the last follows the governed noun.
go— gon in company with
go— phadya together
azh — siwa except
azh— darra without
pha— randa on the track of
azh — phalawa away, from
azh — phadha behind

The postpositions do not put the noun governed in an oblique case in the singular. The force is often that of the genitive, which has no distinct form in the singular, but, as might be expected, the genitive plural is often used. Pronouns also take the genitive in the singular.

sara on
chakha on, upon
nemgha, negha, pthalawa towards
sanga on account of
phadya along with
nyama, nyanwan in
darra out of
khund, gwara near
dema before, in front of
phadha behind, after
phesha before (in time)
sara, kharcha over
buna under
'shanbara beyond
'shinbara on this side of
phar for, on account of
rubaru in the presence of
lafa in, in the middle of
daula, wajha like

Examples.
kholi buna under the hill
khohani sara on the hills
go wathi sardara with his own chief
dreghi pha unana khataen falsehood is a blot upon honour
dast jant avr barziya she puts her hand into the bag
eshiya phadha after this

bozhi lafa in the boat
go ma phadya together with me

**ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS OF TEXT BOOK.**

**PART I.— Miscellaneous stories.**

Stories 1 to 4 are ordinary Oriental apologues.

No. 5.— 'The Two Wrestlers' is a curious local tale of apparently mythical origin.

No. 6.— 'The Peasant, the Tiger and the Jackal' is a story showing the cleverness of women.

No. 7. — 'The Four Men who made a woman' is a well-known story to be found in many languages.

No. 8. — 'The Clever Boy' appears to be an original story.

No. 9. — 'The Three Fools' comprises some widely-spread stories. The first is the same story as told in the Scotch ballad 'Get up and bar the Door.' The second of the man and his two wives is found, among other places, in the Anvar-i-Suhaili, Chapter 11, 3, and in Aesop's Fables.

No. 10.— 'The Shepherd who became a King and his Wazir' seems original. The adventures of the Wazir in the land under the water might be paralleled from many sources.

No. 11, — 'Nadir Shah' — An interesting tradition of Nadir Shah's invasion of India.

The Legends of Shah Jahan are of a similar nature, and all of them depart considerably from historical truth.

No. 12.—'The Prince, the Wazir, the Kotwal and the Slave'—This story opens with the favourite device of a prince who broke the pitchers of the women who came to draw water, and was afterwards banished by the king (cf. Raja Risalu, Legends of the Punjab, Vol. I, page 6). This recurs in the Parrot's Tale (see under No. 21).

No. 13.—'The Three Wonderful Gifts.'— Probably not of Baloch origin.

No. 14.- 'Naina Bai.' — This is a long story of adventure and intrigue, in which the leading characters are a prince, a Baloch goat-herd and a Hindu woman. It is apparently of local origin.

No. 15. — 'The Prophet Dris.' — Dris is the Balochi form of Idris, who is generally identified with Enoch. This story is one of some interest. The first part is identical with the legend of the exposure of 39 children on Mount Chihaltan near Quetta, as related by Masson (Masson's Travels, II, 80). In that legend, however, the miracle is attributed to Hazrat Ghaus, and Dris is not mentioned. The remainder of the story is a romantic narrative apparently unconnected with the Idris or Enoch of the Quran or the Old Testament. It concludes, however, with an account of his departure from this earth, which is probably derived from Muhammadan sources.

No. 16. — 'The King and the four Thieves.' — This is almost identical with the adventure of Mahmud Ghaznavi given in the Kalid-i-Afghani (No. XL).

No. 17. — 'Dosten and Shiren.' — A genuine Baloch legend (see also No. 1, Part IV).

No. 18. — 'Abdulla Khan of Kelat' — This relates to the invasion of the Derajat and capture of the town of Jampur by Abdulla Khan and the carrying off to Kelat by his son, Muhabbat Khan, of a Mochi's wife, and the miraculous restoration of the latter to her husband.

Nos. 19, 20 and 21 require no special remarks.

No. 24.— 'The Parrot and the Maina' is a fable of a dispute between these birds, each of which relates a story. This story of Agharbano, told by the Maina, is a romantic story of a cruel princess who exacted impossible tasks from her lovers, and finally was deceived herself by a woman disguised as a prince. The second story told by the Parrot opens in the same way as No. 12.

No. 25. — 'Prince Nihal and the Fish' is a fanciful story of a similar style to many in the 'Arabian Nights.' This embodies also the stories (1) of the king who unjustly killed his hawk (identical with the story in Anwar-i-Suhaili, VI, 3), and (2) of the king who killed his parrot.

No. 26. — 'The Adventures of a certain Prophet.' — This is a romantic story, which might be told of a prince as well as of a prophet.

No. 27. — 'Abdullah Shah of Samin.' — A local legend of the Dera Ghazi Khan District introducing an account of the life in the afterworld of the celebrated Punjabi lovers, Hir and Ranjha. This has already been printed in the Roman character, with a translation, in Captain R. C. Temple's Legends of the Punjab, II, 177—161.

Nos. 28, 29 and 30. — Legends regarding the Prophet Moses, illustrating the workings of Providence. No. 30 is given by Lane in the notes to his translation of the 'Arabian Nights' (II, 677).

No. 31. — 'The story of Lai Padshah' is a romantic story bearing a strong resemblance to the story of Agharbano (see under No. 24).

No. 32.— 'Legends of Ali' (known to the Balochis as Yalil). The first part relates how he sold himself as a slave in order to obtain the wherewithal to give to a man who was in need, and also gives an account of the origin of the saint Sakhi Sarwar, and of the Kambarani tribe, to which the ruling family of Kelat belongs. The second part is the legend of the hawk and the dove, showing how Ali was willing to give his own flesh to satisfy a hawk and prevent it from killing a dove. These legends are also given in a poetical form in Part III.

No. 33. — This is a specimen of modern Balochi narrative, being an account of a fight between the Kakars and Hadianis, taken down from the narration of Lashkaran Hadiani, who himself took part in it.
